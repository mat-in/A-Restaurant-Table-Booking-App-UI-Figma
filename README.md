## ACTIVITY 1 - HOME
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d599a34d-b945-4a0f-8a64-0ca9efc12845)
I've designed a mobile website/app user interface for my restaurant, Little Lemon, located in Chicago. The design features our yellow lemon logo and uses a color scheme of yellow, white, and dark green.

In the header, I've described Little Lemon as a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant that focuses on traditional recipes with a modern twist. I've included a prominent "Reserve a table" button for easy bookings.

Below that, I've added an "ORDER FOR DELIVERY!" section with menu categories like Lunch, Mains, Desserts, and A La Carte.

The menu items I've showcased include:

1. Our Greek Salad for $12.99
2. Our Brushetta for $7.99
3. Our Grilled Fish (I still need to add the price for this one)

Each menu item has a small image and brief description. I've aimed for a clean and user-friendly interface, designed for easy mobile ordering and browsing of our restaurant's offerings.

My next steps will be to complete the menu listings and refine the user experience based on customer feedback.

## ACTIVITY 2 - FIND A TABLE

I've designed a table reservation feature for the Little Lemon restaurant app. The interface includes:

1. A "Find your table" header at the top.

2. Three required fields marked with asterisks:
   - DATE: Set to 25/08/2023 with a calendar icon
   - TIME: Currently showing 19:30 with left and right arrows for adjustment
   - GUESTS: Set to 4 with a person icon

3. An optional TABLE selection with three choices:
   - Inside
   - Event Zone
   - Outside
   All options are selected by default.

4. A yellow "Place Order" button with a bicycle icon, suggesting delivery options.

5. At the bottom, I've added an image showcasing two dishes - a salad and what appears to be bruschetta - being served by a waiter, to give users a visual taste of our offerings.

The design maintains the brand's color scheme and clean, user-friendly layout. My next steps will be to implement the backend functionality for this reservation system and test it thoroughly before launch.
